#🚗 CAR Sales Analysis – Data Analytics Project
A data-driven exploratory analysis of a car sales dataset to uncover key market insights, trends, and pricing drivers. This project involved data cleaning, imputation, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🔍 Objectives
Clean and preprocess messy automotive sales data (missing values, type inconsistencies, duplicates)
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on vehicle features, prices, and manufacturer data
Visualize correlations between vehicle specifications and pricing

📊 Key Insights
Price Drivers: Price strongly correlates with horsepower, engine size, and curb weight
Fuel Efficiency Trade-Off: Heavier, more powerful vehicles are less fuel-efficient
Manufacturer Trends: Ford, Dodge, and Chevrolet dominate in model volume
Luxury Segment: Brands like Mercedes-Benz and Porsche command premium pricing
Segment Differences: SUVs and trucks have higher horsepower but lower efficiency compared to passenger vehicles

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Data wrangling, missing value imputation, and outlier detection
Visualizations: histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps

📁 Dataset- From kaggle
The analysis is based on a dataset of car models from ~2011–2012, including specs like price, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and more.
